# Telecom Churn
> In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate.

## General Information
- It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e.,
churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special
plans, discounts on recharge etc.

It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables
may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

Even though overall accuracy will be your primary evaluation metric, you should also mention
other metrics like precision, recall, etc. for the different models that can be used for evaluation
purposes based on different business objectives.
- Analysis of data set using Logistic Regression, Advanced Regression like Random Forest & XGBoost.
- Business probem: RisksÂ are associated with the Telecom Churn:
    1) To predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
    2) It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
- The data set with name "train (1).csv" is used.

## Conclusions
- In Random Forest model the accuracy is 89% where as the recall is 93% without hyperparameter tuning.
- In Random Forest the accuracy is 86% and the recall is 88% with hyperparameter tuning.
- In XGBoost the accuracy is 85% and the recall is 88%. 
- In Logistic Regression the recall is 86%.
